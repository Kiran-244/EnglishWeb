      <p>Teaching, which in itself I believe is a humble yet <em>eloquent</em> profession, has always fascinated me. But
        sadly, today we come across many teachers who entered this field by <strong>chance rather than choice</strong>.
        For me, becoming a teacher was a conscious decision, driven by curiosity and passion.</p>

      <p>One might think of a teacher as someone who simply walks into a classroom with a stack of papers or a textbook,
        asks questions, conducts tests, gives assignments, and repeats the same routine endlessly. I firmly believe that
        teaching cannot be that boring. Although I might appear routine at times, earnestly, I strive to <strong>explore
          new ways to help students learn</strong> more effectively and seamlessly.</p>

      <p>Teaching is always a <strong>two-way process</strong>. When you stand at the lecture stand in front of students
        from diverse backgrounds, religions, and ways of thinking, it gives you a perspective that is truly enriching.
        Initially, one might feel butterflies in the stomach, but gradually, speaking to an audience of learners becomes
        natural and rewarding.</p>

      <p>My journey as an Assistant Professor has immersed me in an environment that provides a <em>wider
          perspective</em> — educational, social, and emotional. Teaching is not just about sharing knowledge; it is
        also about learning. Every interaction, every question, every discussion is an opportunity to grow.</p>

      <p><strong>My curiosity as a teacher</strong> drives me to constantly explore new methods and approaches to
        connect with students, to inspire them, and to create a learning experience that is meaningful and memorable.
