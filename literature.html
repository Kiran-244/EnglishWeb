      <p>My thoughts on literature and language are simple yet profound. Upon reading this, you may find one part of
        your mind <strong>echoing</strong>, <i>“Was it not what I thought about this concept?”</i> At certain moments,
        however, we just feel <span style="color:#6c5ce7;"><strong>short of words</strong></span> to express what we
        truly feel.</p>

      <p>When I was in school, I never dreamed of being an engineer or a doctor — although these are noble pursuits.
        Instead, I was naturally drawn toward <strong>literature and books</strong>. I would find my home in novels,
        exploring worlds far beyond my own, and sometimes dive into literary texts that challenged me to think
        differently.</p>

      <p>Ostensibly, literature may appear intimidating, but as one goes deeper into this <span
          style="color:#00b894;"><strong>nectar of wisdom</strong></span>, one realizes how unaware we were for so long.
        Literature is not just about reading; it is about <strong>experiencing life through words</strong>, feeling the
        heartbeat of every character, and seeing reflections of ourselves in their struggles and triumphs.</p>

      <p>For me, <strong>language is not merely a medium</strong> to communicate ideas; it is a bridge to the heart.
        While the heart cannot always speak directly, we can make it speak through carefully chosen words. This is why I
        chose English as my medium — though, of course, the language itself is only a tool. What matters is the
        <em>authentic expression</em> of thought and feeling.</p>

      <p>Life is complex. Some people walk paths unaware of their destination, while others, like me, turn to books to
        gain insight. Many focus on memorizing facts or gaining intellect, while some attempt to navigate life by
        imitating others. Yet, no one can truly decode the essence of life. What I know is simple: we are human, and we
        must try to understand every side of the spectrum of existence.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, literature and language teach us <strong>empathy, curiosity, and introspection</strong>. Through
        reading, we learn to listen, to imagine, and to grow. Every story, poem, or essay is a mirror and a window —
        reflecting our own experiences while opening us to new perspectives. In the end, the beauty of literature lies
        in its ability to connect hearts and minds across time, space, and culture.</p>
